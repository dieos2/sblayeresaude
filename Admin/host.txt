# this file contains the mappings of ip addresses to host names. each
# entry should be kept on an individual line. the ip address should
# be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.
# the ip address and the host name should be separated by at least one
# space.

# additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.

#       38.25.63.10     x.acme.com              # x client host

# localhost name resolution is handled within dns itself.
